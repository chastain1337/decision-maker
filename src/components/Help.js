                Few people like deciding what to do.
              </p>
              <p>
                In large groups of people it can be hard to make decisions,
                especially when everyone is just <i>so</i> considerate. The
                reality is, when making decisions everyone has a certain{" "}
                <b>independent desire</b>: a level of want that does not
                consider anyone else. Sometimes this is a lot, sometimes it's a
                little.
              </p>
              <p>
                Most people, though, also have a level of{" "}
                <b>dependent desire</b>. That is to say, they only want to do
                something to the extent that those they are with also want to do
                it.
                <i>"Yeah, I'll go if you go."</i>
              </p>
              <p>
                This app uses an advanced formula to factor those desires
                together into a score. Follow these steps.

                "i" is your Independent Desire. Enter a number between -5 and 5,

                "d" is the "Dependency Factor". Enter a decimal between 0 and 1,
                consider:
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    0: "I don't care whether you want to or not, I will drag us
                    all there."

                  <li>

                  <li>
                    1: "I really have no opinion. My desire is completely based
                    on yours."

                Click "Calculate" and the app will average everyone's indepenent
                desire by everyone else's dependency factor. If your score is
                between -5 and -1, you shouldn't do it. If it's between 1 and 5,
                you should. Between -1 and 1, and it's just too close to call.
